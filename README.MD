Pacific Northwest Border Wait Times (PNW BWT) is a lightweight site that shows border wait times between British Columbia, Canada and Washington, USA.

See: https://dfmelicor.github.io/pnw-bwt/

## Why this site?

After crossing the BC and WA border multiple times in 2025, I encountered the pain point of not having an accurate idea of how long the border wait was.

After trying different sources for wait times, I felt DriveBC was the most accurate and also had the added benefit of showing estimates for both directions.

Some apps/sites I tried:
* [CBSA Site](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html) for WA to BC.
* [CBP BWT App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.dhs.cbp.bems.wcr.bwt2&hl=en_US) for BC to WA.
* [DriveBC](https://www.drivebc.ca/) for both directions

This site simply calls the DriveBC API, and shows wait times without all the extra details.
